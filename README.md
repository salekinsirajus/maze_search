# Best Practice
 - Maze is represented with a two-dimensional list in Python
 - The location of a cell is denoted by ```[[row,column]]```
    * Not following this is going to cause a lot fo trouble
 - A set of locations are going to be represented by the following pattern:
```python
[[7,6], [3,5], [0,1], [2,4]]

```
 - Locations are 0-indexed.
